# Rules:

Before you start work for the day/on a new task, make sure your branch is up to date with the dev branch.

After you complete a step (and have it tested) merge dev into your branch then check if it still works. 

Now you can merge into dev. After it has merged test to make sure it still works.

Give a quick notice to everyone that you have updated the dev branch.

DO NOT PUSH TO MASTER WITHOUT GROUP CONSENT
